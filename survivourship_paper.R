#For exp(ùêµ)>1, the interpretation is even easier, as a value of, say exp(ùêµ)=1.259 
#(as is the case for your "stenosis" variable), means that scoring "stenosis" = 1 
#will result in an increased probability (25.9%) of experiencing an end point compared to
#when "stenosis" = 0.     SO 2.4 mean a 140% chance of dying if male?
